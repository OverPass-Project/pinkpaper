Overpass is a standard for faster and cheaper trustworthy computation on smart contracts. The correctness of execution is guaranteed by the verification algorithm on the smart contracts. Off-chain servers are incentivized if the answer passes verification. An equilibrium is achieved where miners receive incentives by reducing usersâ€™ costs under the trust of smart contracts. With OverPass standard, problems with cheap NP verification or doubly effective interactive proof can be computed in a cheaper and faster manner, and this contributes to moving consented trustworthy computers towards a faster, cheaper, and stronger era.
