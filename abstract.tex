When coupled with the theory of computation, the blockchain and cryptographical scheme has demonstrated its utility through several projects, with Ethereum commonly seen as the first decentralized, un-ownable digital computer. In such a decentralized and un-ownable system, control flow integrity is well guaranteed, but the execution of logic and change of states in a such consented virtual machine is slow and expensive due to the message-passing and state consensus between physical nodes. \\
OverPass provides a standard for search delegation where an untrusted advisor gives hints/answer/proof to the client on-chain and extends the computational power of address-based consented virtual machine on solving interactive proof (IP) problems.
